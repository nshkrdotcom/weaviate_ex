# Prompt: Schema Lifecycle & Data Ingestion Foundation

## Context
We are executing Phase 1 of the essential program to harden schema collections, object CRUD, and lightweight batch flows. The scope must align with the essential blueprint (`01_essential_scope.md`) and detailed responsibilities in `02_schema_data_plan.md`. Existing modules (`lib/weaviate_ex/collections.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/api/collections.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/objects.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/api/data.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/batch.ex`) provide partial coverage but lack tenant toggles, raw config passthrough, consistent error mapping, and batch summaries. The implementation must be backwards compatible while enabling the roadmap for Sprints S1â€“S3 in the schema & ingestion pillar.

## Required Reading
- `docs/20251019/01_essential_scope.md`
- `docs/20251019/02_schema_data_plan.md`
- `docs/20251019/10_actionable_implementation_plan.md`
- `lib/weaviate_ex/collections.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/api/collections.ex`
- `lib/weaviate_ex/objects.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/api/data.ex`
- `lib/weaviate_ex/batch.ex`, `test/weaviate_ex/batch_test.exs`
- `test/weaviate_ex/collections_test.exs`, `test/weaviate_ex/api/data_test.exs`

## Implementation Objectives
1. **Collections Reliability**
   - Introduce helper(s) on `WeaviateEx.Collections` to check existence, toggle multi-tenancy, and merge raw config overrides as described in `02_schema_data_plan.md`.
   - Ensure `WeaviateEx.API.Collections` exposes equivalent functions with structured `%WeaviateEx.Error{}` typing for validation/conflict scenarios.
   - Add tenant-aware shard inspection helpers and verify consistent option handling across requests.
2. **Object Lifecycle Polish**
   - Extend `WeaviateEx.Objects` and `WeaviateEx.API.Data` to expose `_additional` fields and consistency/tenant options for all read/write operations.
   - Centralize UUID/vector utilities, ensuring existing callers remain green (feature flag any new defaults).
3. **Batch MVP Preparation**
   - Scaffold `WeaviateEx.API.Batch` (module + struct) responsible for create/delete flows, including summary struct for success/error separation.
   - Update `WeaviateEx.Batch` public module to delegate to the API implementation, preserving current behaviour until new module passes tests (blue/green).
4. **Documentation Hooks**
   - Add moduledocs and inline examples that mirror the quick start narrative; no TODOs left behind.

## TDD & Quality Gates
- Write failing unit tests before implementation: update `test/weaviate_ex/api/collections_test.exs`, `test/weaviate_ex/api/data_test.exs`, and add new tests for batch summary semantics.
- Maintain Blue/Green behaviour by keeping existing public APIs stable; gate new functionality behind explicit options until documentation and tests confirm readiness.
- Require `mix format` + `mix test --color` to pass with zero warnings. Ensure Credo/Dialyzer (if enabled) remain silent.
- Capture review notes inline (docstrings or comments) rather than TODOs; code review checklist must include schema CRUD edge cases and tenant handling.

## Deliverables
- Updated modules (`lib/weaviate_ex/collections.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/objects.ex`, `lib/weaviate_ex/batch.ex`, new `lib/weaviate_ex/api/batch.ex`) with comprehensive moduledocs and examples.
- Expanded tests proving success/error paths, tenant toggles, and batch summaries with all tests passing.
- Documentation cross-reference mention in quick start doc PR description (prepared as part of review).
- Status update entry for Program Ops (Phase 1) indicating Blue environment remains untouched until review sign-off.
