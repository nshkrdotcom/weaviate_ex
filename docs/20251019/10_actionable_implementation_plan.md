# WeaviateEx Essential Implementation Program

**Date:** 2025‑10‑19  
**Drivers:** Platform DX lead, Core API squad leads, PMO  
**Audience:** Engineering squads, tech writers, release management  
**Status:** Ready for sprint planning

---

## 1. Objectives & Guardrails

- **Ship Essentials by Q4 2025:** Deliver the scope in `01_essential_scope.md` with GA quality.  
- **Lean Core Footprint:** Stick to the feature boundaries documented across `02_`, `03_`, and `04_`.  
- **Reliable Delivery Rhythm:** Operate on 3 sprint increments (4 weeks each) with measurable exit criteria.  
- **DX Quality Bar:** Maintain ≥95% test coverage on essential modules and publish updated guides before beta.  
- **Transparency:** Weekly status shared with product and solutions; red/amber issues escalated within 24h.

## 2. Workstreams & Leads

| Workstream | Primary Lead | Dependencies | Key Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Schema & Ingestion** (`02_`) | Core API EM | DevOps for CI Weaviate, Docs | Collections CRUD, batch MVP, module docs |
| **Query & Aggregation** (`03_`) | Search squad tech lead | Schema availability, Vector infra | GraphQL builder, aggregation helpers, query samples |
| **Operations & DX** (`04_`) | Platform DX lead | All feature squads, QA | Error taxonomy, retries/timeouts, tooling, guides |
| **Release & QA** | QA lead | Feature squads | Test harness, soak runs, release notes |
| **Program Ops** | PMO | Finance, hiring | Hiring backfills, risk log, stakeholder comms |

Each workstream maintains a Kanban swimlane in Linear with story templates aligned to the tasks below.

## 3. 12-Week Delivery Timeline

| Phase (4 weeks) | Focus | Must-Complete Deliverables | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1 – Foundations** (Weeks 1‑4) | Stabilize schema & CRUD, baseline infra | Collections refinements, CRUD polish stories from `02_`; local & CI Weaviate clusters; error struct revamp | Integration tests green for schema/object lifecycle; shared API client documented |
| **Phase 2 – Queries & Batch** (Weeks 5‑8) | Implement query builders, rollups, batch flows | Query builders + aggregations from `03_`; batch MVP; docs drafts for quick start | Demo ingest + query sandbox; beta docs reviewed by product |
| **Phase 3 – Hardening & Launch Prep** (Weeks 9‑12) | Performance, DX polish, release readiness | Timeouts/retries, soak test, error taxonomy rollout from `04_`; release checklist; GA announcement draft | 24h soak report clean; GA sign-off from product & support; docs live |

## 4. Epic Breakdown & Actionable Tasks

### 4.1 Foundation Epics (Phase 1)

1. **Collections Reliability**
   - Audit existing schema APIs; close gaps vs. `02_` requirements.
   - Implement `exists?/2`, tenant toggles, raw config passthrough.
   - Create targeted unit tests and live scenarios for duplicate, delete-missing.
2. **Object Lifecycle Polish**
   - Expose `_additional` fetch options.
   - Harden patch/update flows with optimistic conflict handling (document trade-offs).
   - Build regression tests across tenants and consistency modes.
3. **CI & Tooling Setup**
   - Provision managed Weaviate for CI (via Docker compose or SaaS sandbox).
   - Add soak-test harness skeleton (Elixir mix task) shared across squads.
   - Document local developer setup updates.

### 4.2 Query & Batch Epics (Phase 2)

1. **GraphQL Builder**
   - Implement composable query DSL (Get, hybrid, vector, BM25) per `03_`.
   - Support `_additional` metadata and pagination knobs.
   - Add acceptance tests covering hybrid + filter combos.
2. **Aggregation Toolkit**
   - Build rollup helpers (`over_all`, `group_by`, `where` integration).
   - Create sample dashboards/snippets for docs.
   - Benchmark aggregation latency with 100k objects dataset.
3. **Batch MVP**
   - Ship `Batch.create_objects/2` and `Batch.delete_objects/2`.
   - Implement summary struct and partial failure handling.
   - Run performance smoke (1k object ingest) and log results.

### 4.3 Hardening & Launch Epics (Phase 3)

1. **Reliability & DX**
   - Implement retry/backoff strategy with configuration.
   - Finalize error taxonomy; update guides/examples.
   - Capture end-to-end happy path screencast for docs.
2. **Performance & Observability**
   - Finish soak harness; run 24h ingest/search loop with dashboards.
   - Gather metrics (latency, error rate); publish in release notes.
   - Add instrumentation hooks for user extension.
3. **Release Management**
   - Complete release checklist (docs, changelog, migration notes).
   - Coordinate beta feedback closes; freeze scope.
   - GA launch comms with product & solutions.

## 5. Execution Cadence

- **Daily:** 10-minute standup per workstream, cross-stream sync on Tuesdays.  
- **Weekly:** PMO reviews status, updates risk log, circulates one-page summary.  
- **Bi-weekly:** Sprint review demoing completed stories; capture feedback and action items within 48h.  
- **Monthly:** Steering committee sign-off on phase exit; adjust resourcing if blockers persist.

## 6. Risk Radar & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI Weaviate instability | Medium | High | Maintain hot spare environment; nightly validation job | DevOps lead |
| Scope creep from parity requests | High | Medium | Enforce escape hatch via `WeaviateEx.Raw`; log requests for v2.1 triage | Platform DX |
| Batch performance regressions | Medium | High | Benchmark weekly; enable feature flag until soak passes | Core API |
| Documentation lag | Medium | Medium | Pair tech writers with leads; PR docs alongside code | Docs lead |
| Resource availability (holidays) | Low | Medium | PMO keeps vacation calendar; plan cross-training | PMO |

---

## 7. Immediate Next Steps

1. Schedule kick-off meeting (1 hour) with all workstream leads; review deliverables and assign rotation backups.  
2. Translate epics above into Linear projects with initial story breakdown; due by end of Week 1 Day 2.  
3. Stand up CI Weaviate cluster (or confirm existing) and document connection details in engineering handbook.
