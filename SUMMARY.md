# WeaviateEx Integration Test Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
Integration tests were completely failing because:
1. Mock HTTP client was being used even when integration tests were enabled
2. The `setup_all` in integration test modules was being called BEFORE the HTTP client was configured

## Solution Implemented
1. **test_helper.exs**: Always define the Mock (needed for unit tests), default to Mock mode
2. **Integration test modules**: Each `setup_all` now explicitly switches to `WeaviateEx.HTTPClient.Finch` 
3. **Process isolation**: Integration tests run with `async: false` to avoid conflicts

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- **Unit tests**: 45/45 passing (with mocks)
- **Integration test infrastructure**: Fully functional
- Integration tests successfully connect to real Weaviate at http://localhost:8080
- All 5 integration test suites running against live instance

### üîß Integration Test Results
```
98 total tests
- 45 unit tests: ‚úÖ PASSING  
- 53 integration tests: 32 ‚úÖ PASSING, 21 ‚ùå FAILING
```

### Failing Integration Tests (21)
These are **expected failures** revealing real Weaviate API behavior that differs from our mocks:

#### Collections (2 failures)
- Duplicate collection error status code
- Delete non-existent collection error handling

#### Batch Operations (7 failures) 
- Partial failure handling
- Custom ID batch creation
- Delete operations with where clauses
- Cross-reference batch operations

#### Query Operations (7 failures)
- BM25 keyword search
- near_vector similarity search  
- Hybrid search
- Where filtering with operators
- Combined filters

#### Objects (5 failures)
- Update/patch operations (field immutability)
- Validate operations
- Delete error handling

## Next Steps
The integration test failures reveal:
1. API response format differences
2. Error status code mismatches
3. Field validation rules (e.g., 'id' is immutable on update)
4. Query syntax requirements

Each failure provides valuable feedback for fixing the actual implementation!

## How to Run

```bash
# Unit tests only (with mocks)
mix test

# Integration tests (requires Weaviate running on localhost:8080)
mix test --include integration

# Unit tests only (explicit)
mix test --exclude integration
```
