# WeaviateEx v2.0 - Design Summary

> Complete design documentation for rebuilding WeaviateEx with 100% feature parity with weaviate-python-client

---

## Executive Summary

This document collection provides a complete blueprint for rebuilding WeaviateEx as a production-ready, feature-complete Elixir client for Weaviate with 100% parity to the official Python client.

### What's Included

1. **FEATURE_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md** - Comprehensive feature tracking (~500 features)
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Clean code design and module organization
3. **TEST_DESIGN.md** - TDD strategy with Mox and comprehensive test suite
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - 22-week implementation plan
5. **This Summary** - Quick start guide and overview

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have (v1.0)

**Implemented (Basic):**
- Collections API (CRUD)
- Objects API (CRUD)
- Batch operations (basic)
- GraphQL queries (semantic, vector, hybrid, BM25)
- Health checks
- Mix tasks for Docker
- API key authentication

**Test Coverage:**
- 45 unit tests (passing with mocks)
- 53 integration tests (32 passing, 21 failing)

**Assessment:**
- ~3% feature complete vs Python client
- Basic functionality works
- Missing: gRPC, advanced queries, RAG, multi-tenancy, RBAC, 25+ vectorizers, etc.

### What We Need (v2.0)

**Target:**
- 100% feature parity with weaviate-python-client v4
- ~500 features across 30+ categories
- Production-ready: performance, reliability, error handling
- Complete documentation and examples
- Comprehensive test suite

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Architecture

**Layered Design:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Client API (User-Facing)        │  WeaviateEx, Collections, Query
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Domain Logic                     │  Filters, Builders, Config
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Protocol Layer                   │  HTTP (Finch), gRPC (Gun)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Connection Management            │  Pooling, Health, Retries
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable in isolation
- Swappable implementations
- Easy to extend

### 2. API Style

**Collection-Scoped Operations:**
```elixir
# Python style (method chaining)
client.collections.get("Article").data.insert({...})

# Our Elixir style (functional, pipe-friendly)
client
|> WeaviateEx.Collections.get("Article")
|> WeaviateEx.Collection.Data.insert(%{...})

# Or more concise
collection = WeaviateEx.Collections.get(client, "Article")
WeaviateEx.Collection.Data.insert(collection, %{...})
```

**Query Builder (Fluent API):**
```elixir
Query.new(collection)
|> Query.near_text("machine learning")
|> Query.where(Filter.by_property("category") |> Filter.equal("tech"))
|> Query.limit(10)
|> Query.with_additional([:id, :certainty])
|> Query.execute()
```

**Rationale:**
- Idiomatic Elixir (explicit over implicit)
- Pipe-friendly
- Pattern matching on results
- Clear data flow

### 3. Error Handling

**Pattern:**
```elixir
case WeaviateEx.Collections.get(client, "Article") do
  {:ok, collection} ->
    # Success path

  {:error, %WeaviateEx.Error{type: :not_found}} ->
    # Handle not found

  {:error, error} ->
    # Generic error handling
end

# Or bang version
collection = WeaviateEx.Collections.get!(client, "Article")  # raises on error
```

**Rationale:**
- Standard Elixir convention
- Forces error handling
- Pattern matching friendly
- Bang versions for convenience

### 4. Protocol Selection

**Strategy:**
- Prefer gRPC for batch operations (performance)
- Use HTTP for simple requests (simplicity)
- Automatic fallback (gRPC → HTTP)
- Per-operation override

**Rationale:**
- Best of both worlds
- Graceful degradation
- User control when needed

### 5. Testing Strategy

**TDD Approach:**
1. Write comprehensive tests first
2. Stub implementations (raise NotImplementedError)
3. Implement one feature at a time
4. Watch tests turn green
5. Refactor with confidence

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests with Mox (default, fast)
- Integration tests (opt-in, requires Weaviate)
- Property-based tests (complex logic)
- Performance benchmarks

**Rationale:**
- Ensures correctness
- Documents expected behavior
- Enables refactoring
- Catches regressions

---

## Testing Approach

### Test First, Always

**For Every Feature:**

1. **Write the test** (it will fail)
```elixir
test "list/1 returns all collections", %{client: client} do
  expect_http_success(Mock, :get, "/v1/schema", %{
    "classes" => [%{"class" => "Article"}]
  })

  assert {:ok, ["Article"]} = Collections.list(client)
end
```

2. **Stub the implementation** (raises NotImplementedError)
```elixir
def list(_client) do
  raise "NOT IMPLEMENTED: Collections.list/1"
end
```

3. **Run the test** (verify it fails correctly)
```bash
mix test test/weaviate_ex/api/collections_test.exs
# Expected: NotImplementedError
```

4. **Implement the feature**
```elixir
def list(client) do
  case Protocol.request(client, :get, "/v1/schema", %{}, []) do
    {:ok, %{"classes" => classes}} ->
      {:ok, Enum.map(classes, & &1["class"])}

    {:error, error} ->
      {:error, error}
  end
end
```

5. **Run the test** (verify it passes)
```bash
mix test test/weaviate_ex/api/collections_test.exs
# Expected: PASS
```

6. **Refactor** (tests ensure correctness)

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** 100% coverage (with Mox mocks)
- **Integration Tests:** 80% coverage (with live Weaviate)
- **Property Tests:** Complex logic (filters, builders)
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmarks for critical paths

## Conclusion

This design provides a complete roadmap for building a production-ready, feature-complete Weaviate client for Elixir. By following the TDD approach, maintaining clean architecture, and implementing features in priority order, we can deliver a high-quality library that matches the Python client's functionality while leveraging Elixir's strengths.

**The current codebase can be thrown out if needed** - these designs represent a clean slate approach focused on long-term maintainability, testability, and feature completeness.
